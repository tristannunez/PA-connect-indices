# #ProNet
# from Zhicong's presentation
# For a PA network in a landscape that includes n PA patches,the area of PA patch i was noted as a[i] (i= 1,2â€¦. , n)
# the total area of the PA network was A[N]= sum over i ... n of a[i]
# total area of the landscape was A[L] 
# the distance between PA patch i and j was noted as d[ij](Euclidean, least-cost or resistance distance)
# the probability of direct dispersal between PA patch i and j was noted as p[ij]
# the maximum product probability of all possible paths between PA patch i and j (including single-steppaths) was noted as p*[ij]


# first, we are only interested in a specific landscape or study area
# which I think means we will loop through the study area polygons and select the areas 

# select a specific study area

# use package grainscape to divide up the landscape into clusters, uses resistance distance too.
